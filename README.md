# Data-Analysis-Dashboad2
Zomato Restaurants Analysis (spelled “analysys” in the dashboard).
 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze Zomato restaurant data across different countries and cities in order to understand:

Restaurant distribution

Availability of services (online delivery, table booking)

Popular cuisines

Ratings and votes distribution

Trends in customer preferences

This helps stakeholders (Zomato, restaurant owners, or analysts) make data-driven decisions about market performance and customer behavior.
